# AlignmentView
The AlignmentView package will take as input a BAM/SAM file , a specific read ID and a Genome provided by the user. The output will show the precise  sequence alignment of the provided read ID to the reference genome according to the mapped readâ€™s CIGAR string. Nucleotides are given a color in order to have a clear visualization of the alignment.
